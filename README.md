# Numpy
Numerical Python, or "Numpy" for short, is a foundational package on which many of the most common data science packages are built.
Numpy provides us with high performance multi-dimensional arrays which we can use as vectors or matrices. 
The key features of numpy are: ndarrays: n-dimensional arrays of the same data type which are fast and space-efficient.
There are a number of built-in methods for ndarrays which allow for rapid processing of data without using loops (e.g., compute the mean). 
Broadcasting: a useful tool which defines implicit behavior between multi-dimensional arrays of different sizes. 
Vectorization: enables numeric operations on ndarrays. Input/Output: simplifies reading and writing of data from/to file.
